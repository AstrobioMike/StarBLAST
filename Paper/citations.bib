	abstract = {Genomics is not only essential for students to understand biology but also provides unprecedented opportunities for undergraduate research. The goal of the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP), a collaboration between a growing number of colleges and universities around the country and the Department of Biology and Genome Center of Washington University in St. Louis, is to provide such research opportunities. Using a versatile curriculum that has been adapted to many different class settings, GEP undergraduates undertake projects to bring draft-quality genomic sequence up to high quality and/or participate in the annotation of these sequences. GEP undergraduates have improved more than 2 million bases of draft genomic sequence from several species of Drosophila and have produced hundreds of gene models using evidence-based manual annotation. Students appreciate their ability to make a contribution to ongoing research, and report increased independence and a more active learning approach after participation in GEP projects. They show knowledge gains on pre- and postcourse quizzes about genes and genomes and in bioinformatic analysis. Participating faculty also report professional gains, increased access to genomics-related technology, and an overall positive experience. We have found that using a genomics research project as the core of a laboratory course is rewarding for both faculty and students.},

            Comparing newly obtained and previously known nucleotide and amino-acid sequences underpins modern biological research. BLAST is a well-established tool for such comparisons but is challenging to use on new data sets. We combined a user-centric design philosophy with sustainable software development approaches to create Sequenceserver, a tool for running BLAST and visually inspecting BLAST results for biological interpretation. Sequenceserver uses simple algorithms to prevent potential analysis errors and provides flexible text-based and visual outputs to support researcher productivity. Our software can be rapidly installed for use by individuals or on shared servers.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in languages and systems for large scale distributed computing. Unfortunately, most systems available to the end user use a custom description language tightly coupled to a specific runtime implementation, making it difficult to transfer applications between systems. To address this problem we introduce Makeflow, a simple system for expressing and running a data-intensive workflow across multiple execution engines without requiring changes to the application or workflow description. Makeflow allows any user familiar with basic Unix Make syntax to generate a workflow and run it on one of many supported execution systems. Furthermore, in order to assess the performance characteristics of the various execution engines available to users and assist them in selecting one for use we introduce Workbench, a suite of benchmarks designed for analyzing common workflow patterns. We evaluate Workbench on two physical architectures -- the first a storage cluster with local disks and a slower network and the second a high performance computing cluster with a central parallel filesystem and fast network -- using a variety of execution engines. We conclude by demonstrating three applications that use Makeflow to execute data intensive applications consisting of thousands of jobs.},
